# Getting and cleaning data assigment.
This repository contains the code for the final assignment for the Coursera's course "Getting and Cleaning Data".

# Available files in the repository
- README.txt   : list the purpose and the content of the repository.
- CodeBook.md  : explain the code applied and the variables used to obtain the tidy dataset wanted.
- tidy_data_avg.txt : contain the tidy data with labels included and with a tab separator.
- run_analysis.R : the R code explained in the CodeBook.md

This run_analysis.R code does the following work:
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
